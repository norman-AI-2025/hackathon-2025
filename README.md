# Creditsphere AI

## Main Goal
To build an LLM-based prototype that assesses credit risk based on **structured data (numeric)** and **unstructured data (text)** for individuals and businesses, in a way that is **transparent, explainable, and reliable**.

---

## Project Overview
**Creditsphere AI** is an AI-driven credit risk scoring system that evaluates both personal and business loan applicants using a combination of:

- Financial & numerical data  
- Natural-language reasoning from user-provided explanations  

The system provides **clear explanations** for each decision, ensuring full transparency and trustworthiness.

---

## Specific Issues Faced

### 1. Interpreting Text
Developing an algorithm that accurately analyzes context from unstructured text inputs.

### 2. Generating Appropriate Responses
Designing a mechanism that produces clear explnation and transparent decision based on the user’s financial and text reasoning.

### 3. Fusion of Numeric and Text Scoring Systems
Building an algorithm that finds the **right balance** between numerical metrics and text-based reasoning to produce a final, accurate risk score.

---

## Specifications

### **1. Numeric Risk Engine**
Processes quantitative financial data such as:
- Salary  
- Expenses  
- Debts  
- Cash flow  
- Revenue  
- Profit  
- Collateral  
- DSCR  
- Loan amount  

### **2. Text Reasoning Engine**
Analyzes unstructured text like applicant explanations or business plans for:
- Clarity  
- Credibility  
- Intent  
- Risk indicators  

### **3. Score Fusion Model**
Combines numeric and text-based results into a **single final risk rating** using weighted logic.

### **4. Explainability Module (XAI)**
Generates clear, transparent explanations for:
- Approvals  
- Rejections  
- Borderline decisions  

### **5. Real-Time UI (Streamlit)**
Provides:
- Interactive forms for personal and business loan applications  
- Instant scoring results and visual feedback
